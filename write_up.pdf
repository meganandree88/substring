Part 1:
substring.py contains two functions, inSubstring and main. The main function prompts the user for the input of two strings. The main function then calls the isSubstring function. isSubstring takes two parameters, stringOne and stringTwo. If the length of stringOne is greater than the length of stringTwo, the function will return the original value of the Boolean variable, False, because stringOne is not a substring of stringTwo. If the length of stringOne is not greater than the length of stringTwo, isSubstring will compare stringOne to stringTwo for each character in stringTwo starting at a specific chacter. If the first character of stringOne is not the same as the first character of stringTwo, the function will compare the first chracter of stringOne with the second character of stringTwo, and so on. For the length of stringOne, if a character of stringOne is the same as the character of stringTwo, a value of one is added to an accumulator variable named acc. If acc is equal to the length of stringOne, then stringOne is a substring of stringTwo and the isSubstring function sets the Boolean variable to True. If stringOne is not found inside of stringTwo, the isSubstring will return the original value of the Boolean variable, False. After comparing stringOne to stringTwo letter by letter, isSubstring will return the value of the Boolean variable, True or False, to the main function, and the main function will print out the result.
